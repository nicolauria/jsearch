Hello:

Hope your 2019 is off to a great start.

Thanks for your interest (via Angel.co) in the Software Engineer position at Roo.  We're excited to find someone to join our team!

As a first step - we'd like to provide you a simple coding challenge which reflects some of the work you'd do at Roo.  See below for the information.

Assuming you'd like to proceed, please email me back your work/info no later than next Monday, Jan 21, 5pm PT (the sooner the better too!) 

Good luck and thanks again!
