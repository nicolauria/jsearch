Hi Jim,

My name is Nico Lauria. I'm a software developer in the San Francisco Bay Area.
I have five years of experience developing websites and two years
of experience developing web applications. My skills include Javascript,
Node, React, Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I'm comfortable
buildings apps using OOP, MVC and REST.

When it comes to testing, I have worked with Rspec and Jasmine. The majority
of my experience has been building unit tests for Ruby classes and algorithms
but I have also done integration and end-to-end tests as well.

I'm comfortable building database schemas and using raw SQL to build the
tables. I've also worked with ORM's such as Rails Active Record.

I have a good understanding of data structures, algorithms and time and
space complexity. After looking at the job description for the
for the Software Engineer position I feel I am qualified and might be a good addition to your team. I welcome the opportunity to speak with you further.

Best,
Nico
