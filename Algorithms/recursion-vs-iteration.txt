recursion uses more memory but is sometimes clearer to read and uses less code
for example, working with binary trees

in java, c, and python recursion is fairly expensive because it requires the
allocation of new stack frames.

functional programming = building pure functions and avoiding shared state
- code tends to be more concise, more predictable, and easier to test

Pure functions are functions that accept an input and returns a value without
modifying any data outside its scope (Side Effects)

using looping constructs in functional programming can be expensive because of
the interaction between the mutator and the garbage collector
