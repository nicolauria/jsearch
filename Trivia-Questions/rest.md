# REST

REST or Representational State Transfer is an architectural style for computer
systems. A REST-compliant system is stateless and separates the concerns of the
client and the server. This means that code on the client side can be changed at
any time without affecting the operation of the server.

REST gives us a standard for making requests to a server. A request generally
consits of:
- an HTTP verb
- a header
- a path
- an optional body

The four basic http verbs we use are:
- GET
- POST
- PATCH
- DELETE

There four verbs allow us to perform CRUD operations. (Create, read, update, delete)
