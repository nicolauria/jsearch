arrays have a fixed size
linked lists have a dynamic size

arrays are inefficient with regards to insertion and deletion
linked lists are efficient

arrays have random access (ie. index 5)
linked lists do not

arrays may result in memory waste (when created can be large size)
linked lists do not waste memory

arrays (sequential access is faster) - stored in contiguous memory
sequential access is slow (not stored in contiguous memory)
