Hi Tiffany,

My name is Nico Lauria. I'm a Junior Software Developer in the San Francisco
Bay Area. I have three years of experience building websites and one year
of experience building software applications. My skills include Javascript,
Node, React, Ruby, Rails, MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

I just graduated from one of the top programming schools in the San Francisco Area and I'm currently exploring new opportunities. I am hardworking, motivated, and I pick up new systems very quickly.

I recently finished two full-stack projects that I feel showcase my skills.
They can be viewed on my portfolio: nicolauria.com

I've attached a copy of my resume. I would love the chance to speak
with you more about my qualifications.

Cheers,
Nico
