Heaps are a type of tree that useful for priority queues. They are unique
in that one very efficient way to implement them is with an array. They are
especially useful for extracting a min/max value from a set of data.

Heaps are just binary trees with two additional rules. They must be complete,
meaning all levels must be filled except the last which must still be left to right.
They must also have all their nodes in order:
min-heap -> parent node less than or equal to child node
max-heap -> parent node greater than or equal to child node

when growing a heap we can only ever add a node to the left-most spot
