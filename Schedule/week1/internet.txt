we send information over the internet inside packets

these packets have a destination and are sent via routers
which control what direction the information takes

larger transfers of information (large image for example) may be
separated into many smaller packets, these packets may take different paths
and may arrive at slightly different times to the destination ip address

having multiple paths makes the internet fault tolerant which means that if
several routes are compromised everything still works

TCP manages the sending and receiving of all data as packets
