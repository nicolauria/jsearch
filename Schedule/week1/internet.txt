we send information over the internet inside packets

these packets have a destination and are sent via routers
which control what direction the information takes

larger transfers of information (large image for example) may be
separated into many smaller packets, these packets may take different paths
and may arrive at slightly different times to the destination ip address

having multiple paths makes the internet fault tolerant which means that if
several routes are compromised everything still works

TCP manages the sending and receiving of all data as packets

requesting a song for example -> packets arrive, tcp checks to make sure
they are all there, then sends a success response back

each missing packet is resent

the more routers we add, the more reliable the internet becomes
