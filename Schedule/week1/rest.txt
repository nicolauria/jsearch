rest stands for representational state transfer
it is a set of design principles for network communication
roy t fielding first coined the term REST in 2000

some architectural constrains of rest:
the network must be made up of clients and servers
one to one relationship

a non-restful alternative is event based integration
in this model each component continuously broadcasts events while listening
for pertinent events from other components

other apis aside from rest include websockets and graphql
websockets use a tcp connection
for continous communication using rest we would need to use polling
polling is basically a refresh button, 98.5% of request are wasted
- hardware intensive because we have to send back a response w/ each request
