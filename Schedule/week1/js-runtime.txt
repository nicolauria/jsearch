the V8 js runtime is actually single threaded. it can only handle one operation
at a time. the browser however provides us with apis and an event loop.

methods such as setTimeout are not part of JS source code, they are provided
by the browser. these functions run separately, once finished they are
moved to the task queue and when the call stack is empty they run.
