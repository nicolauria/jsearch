what happens when you enter google.com and press enter?

we need an ip address
1) check browser cache for matching url
2) check os cache
3) check router cache
4) query the domain name servers of the isp

we need to establish a connection
1) the most common connection protocol is TCP
2) client sends syn packet to server asking if it's open for new connections
3) if the server has open ports it responds with an acknowledgement
of the syn packet with a syn/ack packet.
4) client receives syn/ack and responds with ack packet

client then makes an http request

server reads the request with some kind of request handler

response (JSON, XML, HTML) sent back and read by browser
