server side rendering means all code is parsed on server and we return html page
this allows for faster first time page load
better seo as search engines can more easily parse the code
all interactions with the page once it is rendered are handled client side

rendering a big application server side can be resource intensive
there is a single bottleneck instead of each user parsing code on their machine
