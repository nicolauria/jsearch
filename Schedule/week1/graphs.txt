Arrays and linked-lists are linear data structures. Trees are non linear
data structures. Trees are nothing more than restricted types of graphs.
Trees can only flow in one direction (from the root node to other leaf
nodes or child nodes). A tree cannot have any loops or cyclical links.

There are no rules in the way one node is connected to another node in
graphs. Edges, sometimes referred to as links can connect nodes in any
way possible.

What is a Graph?

G = (V, E)
A Graph is an ADT used to store data. Graphs can be directed or undirected.
Graphs can be weighted or unweighted.
