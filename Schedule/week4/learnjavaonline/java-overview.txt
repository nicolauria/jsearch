Java has been around for 23 years. One of the reasons the language is so
popular is because it is platform independent. A machine just needs a Javascript
Runtime Environment. Where as other languages such as C++ compile code into
platform specific scripts.

Java is fundamentally object-oriented. The code is so robust because Java
objects contain no references to data external to themselves.

Java is a static typed programming language. This means that type checking
is done at compile time vs runtime. One of the advantages is that a lot of
bugs can be detected during compile time.

Better performance: type constraints offer more opportunities for
compiler optimizations

Can make working with relational databases easier.

Debugging can be slower in some ways because of compiler.

The Java programming has 166 packages and thousands of classes. Many of
these packages have to be imported. Java creates a bytecode file that
which is essentially an object file for a virtual machine.
