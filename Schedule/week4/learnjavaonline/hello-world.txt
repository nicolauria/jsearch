In Java every line of code that can actually run needs to be
inside of a class.

When we declare a public class (Main for example) we must declare it
inside a file with the same name (Main.java).

There are 8 primitive data types in Java:
byte (number, 1byte)
short (number, 2bytes)
int (number, 4bytes)
long (number, 8bytes)
float (floating number, 4 bytes)
double (floating number, 8bytes)
char (a character, 2bytes)
boolean (true or false, 1byte)

Java is a strongly typed language which means variables need to be defined
before we declare them.

String is a real data type;
String s1 = new String("Who let the dogs out?");
String s2 = "Who who who?";
String s3 = s1 + s2;
